# bun

This Amazon Products Scrapper was done using Bun.
It was my first time ever using Bun and TypeScript and I was amazed by how fast (and kinda simple) it is.
I used it with a mix of Bun documentation, StackOverflow and Google, and of course ChatGPT (as I said, it was my first time using it).

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
bun add axios
bun add jsdom
bun add express
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

The frontend is very simple and was done using HTML and CSS and Vite with Vanilla JS.

To run the frontend:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Enjoy.
